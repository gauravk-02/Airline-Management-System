Airline Management System
Overview
The Airline Management System project automates the registration process of an airline system. This system handles tasks such as storing and retrieving passenger information, flight details, and booking records, and it facilitates various transactions related to air travel. The backend is powered by a MySQL database, and the frontend is developed using Java Core with Swing for the user interface. The system is designed to manage multiple entities, including airlines, airline employees, and customers, through a structured database schema.

Features
Passenger Management: Store, retrieve, and manage passenger information.
Flight Management: Handle flight details, including adding, updating, and deleting records.
Booking Management: Manage ticket reservations, cancellations, and payment details.
Database Management: Utilize MySQL to store and manage all airline-related data efficiently.
